Compile, configure, and use my project by executing flask run in the terminal window.

I have created a website for Yale University's Chocolate And Confectionary Artisans Organization! CACAO is an undergraduate student-run
organization that provides a venue for students to engage in chocolate-production social enrichment. It is vital that CACAO has a website
to reach a larger amount of the Yale population and to have a place to share event information. On the homepage there are six labeled
pictures in a center grid that are clickable links to different pages on the website. In the top left hand corner is a clickable link
to sign up for CACAO's email list. In the bottom left is a clickable link to email the CACAO Board (when clicked, the mail application
on a mac computer will appear). The bottom right has clickable icons (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube) for CACAO's and
Pencils of Promise's social medias to learn more about both organizations. On each page there is a navigation bar for user convenience
that displays the names of each page of the website and links to them! The entire project uses a brown color scheme to coordinate
with the chocolate subject club.

Clicking on the first image labeled "Meet The Team" the user will be directed to The CACAO Board page. Users will see images of the
members of the CACAO club, a short bio about them, their titles in the club, and a clickable link to their facebook pages (so the user
can connect with them on social media or send them a facebook message inquiring about the club). I made the images circles on this page
to be inside cards so that all of the team members informtion are within a grid to make the page more advanced and professional.
On this page you can see the navigation bar (this page is linked with the "Team" in the nav bar).

The second option in the navigation bar is "About". The About page houses the club's Mission Statement and a graphic showing from the
cacao bar to the chocolate. Third in the navigation bar is "Club Info." The club information page has three columns to cleanly
provide additional information about the club. Under each image is a link to learn more about the process and history of chocolate.
The fourth item in the navigation bar is "Events". The Upcoming Events page displays the dates of the upcoming events and a short
description. At the bottom of the page is carousel which has a slide show to show the user past events and the chocolate made in previous
sessions.

The fifth page is "Recipes". The recipe page is a place where users can search through some delicious chocolate recipes by typing in a
second ingredient. If a second ingredient is not typed, an error will appear telling the user to do so. If there are no recipes with the
second ingredient, the page will refresh having the user type in a different ingredient. Once the ingredient is typed, a list of titles of
recipes (that are clickable to the recipe in a new page) and recipe images will be shown in the center of the page.

The sixth item in the navigation bar is "Donate". Here the user will see information about the charity Pencils of Promise and an image.
At the bottom of the page is a link to CACAO's fundraising page. The seventh item in the nav bar is "Join!". On that page, the user is
prompted for their Name, Yale Email, and to confirm their email. If the user fails to type their name, yale email, confirmation yale, or
if their yale email and confirmation do not match, an error will appear. The user can go back and correctly enter their information. Upon
completion, a confirmation page will appear telling the user they successfully signed up!
